# Logic in writing
1. The easiest order for a reader is to receive the n1ajor, n1ore abstract ideas before he is
required to take in the minor supporting ones. And since the n1ajor ideas arc alvvays
derived from the ntinor ones, the ideal structure of the ideas will ahvays be apyramid of groups of ideas tied together by a single overall thought. Within that
pyramidal structure, the ideas will relate vertically-in that a point at any level
will always be a summary of the ideas grouped below; and horizontally-in
that the ideas will have been grouped together because together they present a
logical argument.
