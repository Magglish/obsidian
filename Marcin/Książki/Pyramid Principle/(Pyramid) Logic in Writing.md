# Logic in writing
1. Reader groups and sumtnarizes ideas as a n1atter of
course in order to remember them. He comprehends ideas presented to him more
readily if they are also grouped and summarized, and presented from the top down.
All of this suggests that the clearest written documents will be those that consis-
tently present their information from the top down, in a pyramidal structure, even
though the original thinking will have been done from the bottom up.
