# Logic in writing
![[Pyramid.png]]

1. Reader groups and sumtnarizes ideas as a n1atter of
course in order to remember them. He comprehends ideas presented to him more
readily if they are also grouped and summarized, and presented from the top down.
All of this suggests that the clearest written documents will be those that consis-
tently present their information from the top down, in a pyramidal structure, even
though the original thinking will have been done from the bottom up.
2. If you are going to group and summarize all your information and
present it in a top-down 1nanner, it would seetn your docun1ent would have to look
something like the structure opposite. The boxes stand for the individual ideas you
want to present, with your thinking having begun at the lowest level by forming
sentences that you grouped logically into paragraphs. You then grouped the para-
graphs into sections, and the sections into the total memorandum represented by
a single thought at the top.
3. Stating this stun mary sentence n1oves you up one level of abstraction and allows you
to think of the paragraph as containing one point rather than six. With this act of
efficiency you now group together, say, three pamgraphs, each containing a single
thought at a level of abstraction one step higher than that of the individual sentences.
4. they must obey **three rules**:
	1. Ideas at any level in the pyrantid ntust always be sun1n1aries
of the ideas grouped below them.
	2.  Ideas in each grouping must always be the same kind of idea.
	3. Ideas in each grouping ntust al-ways be logically ordered.
