# Logic in writing
![[Pyramid.png]]

1. Czytelnicy grupują i sami sobie podsumowują idee aby móc je zapamiętać/zrozumieć. Dlatego warto jest pisać od ogółu do szczegółu - najpierw te ogólne idee, potem bardziej szczegółowe. Jest to sprzeczne z podejściem w myśleniu - w myśleniu najpierw zaczynamy od mniejszych idei aby potem przejść do ogółu.


2. If you are going to group and summarize all your information and
present it in a top-down 1nanner, it would seetn your docun1ent would have to look
something like the structure opposite. The boxes stand for the individual ideas you
want to present, with your thinking having begun at the lowest level by forming
sentences that you grouped logically into paragraphs. You then grouped the para-
graphs into sections, and the sections into the total memorandum represented by
a single thought at the top.
3. Stating this stun mary sentence n1oves you up one level of abstraction and allows you
to think of the paragraph as containing one point rather than six. With this act of
efficiency you now group together, say, three pamgraphs, each containing a single
thought at a level of abstraction one step higher than that of the individual sentences.
4. they must obey **three rules**:
	1. Ideas at any level in the pyrantid ntust always be sun1n1aries
of the ideas grouped below them.
	2.  Ideas in each grouping must always be the same kind of idea.
	3. Ideas in each grouping ntust al-ways be logically ordered.
	   (deductively (major premise, minor premise, conclusion))
	   (chronologically (first, second, third))
	   (structurally (Boston, New York, Washington))
	   (Comparatively (first most itnportant, second most important, etc.))
5. Essentially then, the key to clear writing is to slot your ideas into this
pyramidal form and test them against the rules before you begin to write. If any of
the rules is broken, it is an indication that there is a flaw in your thinking, or that the
ideas have not been fully developed, or that they are not related in a way that will
make their ntessagc instantly clear to the reader. You can then work on refining then1
until they do obey the rules, thus eliminating the need for vast amounts of rewriting
later on.
