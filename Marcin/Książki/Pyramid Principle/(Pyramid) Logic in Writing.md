# Logic in writing
![[Pyramid.png]]

1. Reader groups and sumtnarizes ideas as a n1atter of
course in order to remember them. He comprehends ideas presented to him more
readily if they are also grouped and summarized, and presented from the top down.
All of this suggests that the clearest written documents will be those that consis-
tently present their information from the top down, in a pyramidal structure, even
though the original thinking will have been done from the bottom up.
2. If you are going to group and summarize all your information and
present it in a top-down 1nanner, it would seetn your docun1ent would have to look
something like the structure opposite. The boxes stand for the individual ideas you
want to present, with your thinking having begun at the lowest level by forming
sentences that you grouped logically into paragraphs. You then grouped the para-
graphs into sections, and the sections into the total memorandum represented by
a single thought at the top.
