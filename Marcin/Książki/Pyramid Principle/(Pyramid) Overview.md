1. The easiest order for a reader is to receive the n1ajor, n1ore abstract ideas before he is
required to take in the minor supporting ones. And since the n1ajor ideas arc alvvays
derived from the ntinor ones, the ideal structure of the ideas will ahvays be apyramid of groups of ideas tied together by a single overall thought. Within that
pyramidal structure, the ideas will relate vertically-in that a point at any level
will always be a summary of the ideas grouped below; and horizontally-in
that the ideas will have been grouped together because together they present a
logical argument. 
2. **Magical number seven** - The major problem is that you've run into the magical number seven. This is a phrase coined by George A. Miller in his treatise, "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two."'Â· What he points out is that the mind cannot hold more than about seven iten1s in its short-tern1 1nen1ory at any one tin1e. Son1e n1inds can hold as tnany as nine items, while others can hold only five (I'm a five myself). A convenient number is three, but of course the easiest nun1ber is one.
