Artifact Registry remote repositories are now generally available.  
  
Remote repositories store artifacts from external sources such as Docker Hub or PyPI. A remote repository acts as a proxy for the external source so that you have more control over your external dependencies. The first time that you request a version of a package, Artifact Registry downloads and caches the package in the remote repository. The next time you request the same package version, Artifact Registry serves the cached copy.
